# JSON Web Token!

Hi! This repository contains presentation files about  **JWT** for **Web programming course** @ the Amirkabir University of Technology, and [Dr. Parham Alvani](https://github.com/1995parham) as the Lecturer.



# Files

There is a slideshow presentation file named "JWT.pptx" that contains the presentation material, and There's also a folder named "jwt-example" that includes a client usage example of JWT (and local storage as well). 

### Running the example code

You should have node and npm installed for running the code. Go to the jwt-example folder, run npm install, then run npm start (or bundle.sh). After that, you can merely open index.html and see what's going on!
